I am currently crafting a proposal to implement the pickling of interactively created functions (functions created in a IPython shell for example) and classes into the cpython codebase. There is a lot to talk about.
This repo aims to contain thorough descriptions of the design choices that I or the cloudpickle (open source extension of pickle that supports interactive function pickling. My current proposal is extensively inspired from it) developpers did or were constrained to do to enable this.
I will try to keep these descriptions as didactic and enjoyable as possible, so most of the content will not be plain text, but jupyter notebooks with code examples.
The cpython enhancement proposal will rely on python 3 only. However, you will need python3 and python2 understand the role of retrocompatibility in the current codebase.

More to come soon...
